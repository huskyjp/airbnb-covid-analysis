# Travel New-Normal: Future Airbnb Concept

## TL;DR
- The COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp drop in Airbnb users, and the company was on the verge of a cash shortage due to the cancellation process.
- Simultaneously with the layoffs, the company raised funds and changed its platform concept from short term rental to mid-long term rental.
- As remote work becomes more common for keeping social distancing, Airbnb users have seen a surge in its use as a workspace, with mid-July marking the first time in four months that more than one million room bookings were made. However, it is unsure that it will last and be sustainable.

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit our company, Airbnb, a private accommodation business that has been synonymous with the sharing economy, hard. The company has laid off about 25% of its workforce in response to the volatile home-stay, travel, and hospitality markets. Approximately 1,900 of the current 7,500 employees are affected to prepare the company for a significant shift in its business going forward. Also, since COVID-19, Airbnb has been forced to deal with free housing for medical professionals and 100% refunds for those who cancel trips. Despite raising $1 billion in dead financing, absolute profit declines in its core business have led to inevitable layoffs and the need to change its core business model to fit the new era.

Brian Chesky, Managing Director of the firm, sums up the travel market's reality at this stage in two ways.

1. We donâ€™t know exactly when travel will return.
2. When travel does return, it will look different. 

As stated by the CEO, the company has been searching for a new business model for the travel market's new era since the pandemic happens. One of their efforts has been to change their platform concept from a short-term to a mid- long term accommodation model. Prior to the pandemic, our company focused on the business traveler and general traveler as the primary users of private accommodation facilities. However, they hypothesized that in the post-pandemic era, demand for vacation rental would be focused on workspaces for remote workers and facilities for spending time with small groups of friends, such as family members. Therefore, they changed their central business concept based on medium to long-term use cases. As a result, between May 17 and June 3, Airbnb's room bookings outperformed the YoY comparison. Besides, in mid-July, the company recorded more than 1 million overnight bookings for the first time in four months, and such bookings were characterized by a high number of "non-urban" bookings. A new form of Airbnb is beginning to emerge with social distance in mind. In other words, up until now, Airbnb has typically been a user behavior of "I'm going to use Airbnb because I'm going to visit a city called ~." But at this moment, it seems to be more of a reverse flow of "I want to stay in this Airbnb house or environment, so I'm going to visit a city called ~." Our question is whether we should continue with the concept of medium- to long-term stay concept in 2021 and beyond, should the pandemic show a recovery trend. At this stage, as mentioned above, retention rates are higher than in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. This is because people's lifestyles are changing from urban dwellings and office work to a work-from-home (work-from-anywhere) lifestyle. 

After identifying the data on Airbnb's availability and bookings at this stage, we examine the geographic and physical characteristics of properties that are growing in bookings despite the pandemic.

Based on these numerical facts, it is interesting to explore the future of travel, the potential of Airbnb and the potential in the hospitality business in the era of new travel new normal.
